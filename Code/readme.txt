To get the code working you need to do three things

1. create a subdirectory ./Data
2. go to http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/WIDERFace/ and download the Wider Face Training Images
3. Copy all subdirectories of the training image archive to "Data"
4. Download the Face annotations
5. Copy the wider_face_train_bbx_gt.txt from the Face annotations to "Data"

Now the code should work. Remember not to change the file name of the annotations file.
