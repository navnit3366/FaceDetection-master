# FaceDetection
The aim of this repository is to develop an artifical neuronal network as a student-project which is capable of detecting 
and tracking various faces in pictures and videos. In the first step it will analyse single frames for faces and mark the 
position of them. The second step is optimization. As a result the network shoud be as fast and accurat as possible. This 
step is important for the last stage. Finally the Network will analyse a live video served by a webcam and track the 
faces present in the stream.

The used programming language will be Python.
